            "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.",

            "Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.",
            "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste much of it.",
            "The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts.",
            "It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.",
            "How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.",
            "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste much of it.",
